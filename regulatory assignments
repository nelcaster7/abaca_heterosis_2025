#Regulatory assignments:

#Cis only: significant DE in both P and C. No significant T (FDRP < 0.5%, FDRC<0.5%, FDRT≥0.5%); 
#Trans: Significant DE in P and T, but not C (FDRP < 0.5%, FDRC ≥ 0.5%, FDRT <0.5%); 
#Cis + trans (synergistic): significant DE in P, C and T (FDRP < 0.5%, FDRC < 0.5%, FDRT <0.5%). The signs of the log2FC of these genes in the parental and hybrid are the same. Cis- and trans-regulatory differences favor expression of the same alleles; 
#Cis × trans (antagonistic): significant DE in P, C and T (FDRP < 0.5%, FDRC <0.5%, FDRT <0.5%). The signs of the log2FC of these genes in the parental and hybrid are different. Cis and trans differences favor expression of opposite alleles; 
#Compensatory: Significant DE in C but not P. Significant T (FDRP ≥ 0.5%, FDRC < 0.5%, FDRT < 0.5%);  
#Ambiguous: statistical test exhibits significant DE in only one of the three tests and has no clear biological interpretations (e.g. FDRP ≥ 0.5%, FDRC ≥ 0.5%, FDRT < 0.5%). 
#Conserved: No significant DE in P and C. No significant T (FDRP ≥ 0.5%, FDRC ≥ 0.5%, FDRT ≥ 0.5%);
#Both “conserved” and “ambiguous” genes were omitted from discussions.
